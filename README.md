# Capstone-Project-4
This is my Capstone project 4.
It's a stylish user friendly website that serves to predict the age of a person based on their name while displaying how many people in the world have this name, according to a huge database.
1. Open up your terminal, I would recommend VSCode. Then copy and paste the following command lines
2. git clone https://github.com/Darky321/Capstone-Project-4.git
3. cd Capstone\ Project\ 4/
4. npm i

Your code is now set up. Now steps to run it on your computer. 
1. Type "node index.js" to run the code. The code is now running on port 3000 of your computer.
2. At anytime to stop running the code go to terminal and do "Ctrl + C"
3. Go to your browser, I use Google Chrome. Open a new tab and type in "localhost:3000".
Now you have full access to the website.
